;;; Library-Commentary:

;; This can be used for starting up AUCTeX.  The following somewhat
;; strange trick causes tex-site.el to be loaded in a way that can be
;; safely undone using (unload-feature 'tex-site).

;;; Commentary:

;; AUCTeX is the predominant TeX/LaTeX writing environment for Emacs.

;;; Code:

;; FIXME: I don't quite understand in which way this is better than less
;; strange code such as
;;     (require 'tex-site (expand-file-name "tex-site.el"
;;                         (file-name-directory load-file-name))

(autoload 'TeX-load-hack
  @lisptexsite@)
(TeX-load-hack)

(provide 'auctex)

;;; auctex.el ends here
